# 2D Space Shooter (Complete Unity Project)

This is a complete project of a very simple 2D space shooter game created with Unity.
The game itself is not refined, yet it contains all the "ingredients"
needed to learn the paradigms underlying videogames development including (but not limited to) 
player-enemies interaction, physics, GUI, sounds, 2D parallax, etc.

1. This is a space shooter game so If you are a fan of space shooting games and like to simulate sky fire shooting this is the game for you.
2.This game is developed from classic arcade game genre, old game but with a new context, more vivid graphics, more modern combat scene, fiercer, more glamorous.
3.Your mission is to be the guardian of the galaxy
4.This Game puts you at the Galaxy in an infinite shooting war. You will face an increasingly large number of enemies and you have to deal with many Spaceships and destroy them.
5.Required skills are to provide fast reactions and Memorize enemy invader attack patterns.

I normally use this game for introductory hands-on workshops where participants 
(who often don't have coding skills) learn to build a complete mobile 
video game from scratch in a few hours.

The game is released under a Creative Commons License (see code and
readme files in the sprites folder for more details).
The sprites are taken from a [tutorial on Gamedevtuts+](http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/build-a-space-based-shoot-em-up-in-construct-2--gamedev-12704)
and were designed by [Jacob Zinman-Jeanes](http://jeanes.co).
The C# code for Unity3D has been written from scratch and the gameplay kept simple for
didactic purposes.
